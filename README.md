# Pramana Cx

Pramana Cx is an evidence control plane for mission-critical EPC commissioning. It connects controlled requirements to systems, assets, tests, measurements, findings, approvals, schedules, shipments, and immutable source evidence so that an authorized engineer can make a defensible gate decision.

The product is **advisory by design**. AI may extract, retrieve, rank, draft, and explain. Deterministic services calculate readiness, schedule feasibility, and test verdicts. Only an authorized human review can accept requirements, evidence, checklists, reports, precedents, or gate decisions.

**Where to go from here:**

- **[STATUS.md](STATUS.md)** — what's verified, what's a known gap, and the latest local verification result
- **[agentFixingPlan.md](agentFixingPlan.md)** — the completed remediation plan for the three retrieval-backed agents (compliance, predictive risk, knowledge/RFI)
- **[PLANNER/](PLANNER)** — product intent ([PRD.md](PLANNER/PRD.md)), technical constraints ([TRD.md](PLANNER/TRD.md)), and the reconciled execution baseline ([CanonicalBuildPlan.md](PLANNER/CanonicalBuildPlan.md))
- **[what I have built.md](what%20I%20have%20built.md)** — the chronological build ledger

## How the application works

The normal project journey is intentionally governed rather than a single AI chat:

1. **Select a project:** project membership determines every record and action the user can see.
2. **Control sources:** upload a PDF in Sources or a standard in Cx. The system validates its bytes, hashes the immutable object, extracts page regions, and records exact citations.
3. **Review proposals:** AI may propose requirements, schedule inputs, or cited Cx steps. A reviewer must accept, edit, or reject each proposal before it gains authority.
4. **Model the facility:** create systems, assets, and approval gates, then connect records through typed provenance edges.
5. **Collect evidence:** capture online or offline field evidence. New evidence starts pending; an authorized reviewer decides whether it proves an accepted requirement.
6. **Execute commissioning:** run cited checklist steps. Numeric and boolean verdicts are deterministic; narrative observations stay routed to human judgment. An approved report becomes immutable evidence.
7. **Check compliance:** semantically discover candidate deviations, or compare an accepted requirement against an exact target citation directly. Deviations create only proposed findings until an engineer accepts the disposition.
8. **Plan and monitor:** review tasks/resources, validate dependencies, and create an immutable CP-SAT baseline. Risk polling records all four source outcomes and raises only new material advisory delays; it never changes schedule dates.
9. **Resolve work:** accepted failures and findings appear in Actions; stable alerts appear in Command Center. Owners move findings through assigned, in-progress, resolved, and reopened states.
10. **Decide readiness:** readiness recomputes from accepted proof, stale/failed evidence, predecessor gates, and open blockers. Approval requires permission, a substantive reason, and fresh TOTP in credentials mode.
11. **Generate turnover:** only an approved gate can produce a hashed turnover manifest and independently verifiable artifact.

The Graph and Changes surfaces are supporting views across this journey: Graph answers how records are connected; Changes shows what a controlled revision invalidated and why.

The Next.js process owns authentication, authorization, validation, and synchronous domain commands. Expensive or retryable work crosses the durable BullMQ boundary. PostgreSQL is the business authority; object storage contains immutable source/evidence/report/turnover bytes; the relational `edges` table supplies graph traversal without introducing a second operational database.

Predictive risk can observe, explain, and propose. It cannot apply a mitigation, change a dependency/resource constraint, invoke a re-solve, or alter dates. A scheduler must make a separate reviewed schedule change before the deterministic solver can create another immutable version.

Every authoritative record is tenant/project scoped. Cross-project IDs are rejected at the API boundary. `edges` hold traversable provenance, while normalized relational tables remain the authority for permissions and business state. Audit events are append-only and hash-linked per project.

</details>

## Technology and authority choices

- **Web/API:** Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript, Zod
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 16 through Drizzle; pgvector image in the Compose topology
- **Graph:** typed relational `edges` table, avoiding a second operational database until traversal evidence proves it necessary
- **Jobs:** Redis and BullMQ with durable database job state and idempotency keys
- **Object storage:** one local/S3-compatible boundary; MinIO is the local production analogue
- **Document extraction:** lightweight PyMuPDF service with page, bounding-box, and content-hash provenance
- **Scheduling:** isolated FastAPI OR-Tools CP-SAT service; infeasibility is returned, never hidden
- **AI:** a split, schema-validated provider boundary — `MODEL_PROVIDER` (`mock`/`gemini`/`nim`) for structured generation, `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER` (`mock`/`service`) for embeddings — with a JSON-repair retry shared by every real (non-mock) provider so one malformed response doesn't fail a job outright. The deterministic mock is the default and keeps the offline verification matrix green regardless of which hosted model is configured; every AI-authored suggestion is labeled with its source and model version in the audit trail and lands `reviewState: "proposed"`, never auto-accepted
- **Retrieval:** a third stateless FastAPI service (`services/retrieval`, port 8003) alongside ingestion and the solver, serving `BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5` embeddings (768-dim, matching the existing `vector(768)` column with no migration) and `BAAI/bge-reranker-base` cross-encoder reranking; it holds no database credentials, and project scoping stays in SQL behind the existing permission checks. Every stored vector is tagged with the model that produced it, so a provider switch degrades to fewer results rather than silently corrupting cosine rankings across incompatible vector spaces
- **Authentication:** owned credentials/TOTP or Clerk adapter; all authorization remains in project memberships and server-side permissions
- **Design system:** IBM Plex Serif headings, Hanken Grotesk body, JetBrains Mono labels; primary `#2D463E`, secondary `#B5651D`, tertiary `#583935`, neutral `#FDFBF7`

## Local operation

### Complete Docker topology

Docker Desktop must be running before using Compose. If `docker.sock` is missing, start Docker Desktop and wait until `docker info` succeeds.

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
docker info
docker compose up --build
```

The web application is configured for [http://localhost:4173](http://localhost:4173), not port 3000. Compose starts PostgreSQL/pgvector, Redis, MinIO, ingestion, solver, retrieval, core API, and worker. The retrieval container is only load-bearing when `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=service`; it is probed for visibility but never forces the platform into a degraded state under the default `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=mock`.

### Existing local-service fallback

The application can also run against separately started PostgreSQL, Redis, ingestion, and solver processes. After those dependencies are healthy:

```bash
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed
npm run system:start
```

`system:start` applies migrations, creates a production build, checks PostgreSQL, Redis, ingestion, and solver health, and then supervises the web process and BullMQ worker together on port 4173. Use `Ctrl+C` to stop both application processes cleanly.

### Verification

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm run verify:all
```

`verify:all` is the authoritative local matrix — migrations, type-check, production build, seeded prerequisites, isolated development and credentials runtimes, and every `verify:*` script (auth, evidence/turnover, schedule, Cx, compliance, predictive-risk, knowledge, model-provider, audit). It runs entirely under the deterministic mock, so it's offline with no containers or API keys required. `verify:retrieval-service` skips cleanly under the default `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=mock` and only exercises the real container when `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=service` is set. Individual `npm run verify:<name>` scripts (see `package.json`) can be run standalone against a running dev server for faster iteration on one area. See [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) for what the last full run actually covered.

## Configuration requiring manual credentials

The default local stack uses development authentication, local object storage, and the deterministic mock model. Production-like integrations require values in `.env.local`:

- Clerk publishable/secret keys only if `AUTH_MODE=clerk` is selected
- a strong `AUTH_ENCRYPTION_KEY` when owned credentials/TOTP are used
- Gemini API key only if `MODEL_PROVIDER=gemini` is selected; an NVIDIA `NIM_API_KEY` only if `MODEL_PROVIDER=nim` is selected (hosted by default at `NIM_BASE_URL`, or point it at a self-hosted NIM endpoint)
- no credential is required for `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=service` — the retrieval container serves open-weights models locally; only Docker is required
- S3/MinIO endpoint, bucket, region, access key, and secret when `OBJECT_STORAGE_DRIVER=s3`
- procurement, equipment-lead-time, workforce, and weather endpoint URLs when `RISK_POLL_MODE=http`
- AIS and shipment congestion/weather credentials when real shipment providers replace synthetic estimates

Never commit `.env.local` or credentials.
